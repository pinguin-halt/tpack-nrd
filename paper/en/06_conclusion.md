## 6. Conclusion

This study investigated how Project-Based Learning influences pre-service science teachers' integrative lesson planning competence, conceptualized as the simultaneous integration of TPACK, STEM, and ESD dimensions in lesson plan design. Using a pre-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design with 95 pre-service science teachers and a combination of paired tests, N-Gain analysis, and PLS-SEM with 5,000 bootstrap iterations, the study addressed five research questions and tested three hypotheses. The key findings are summarized below.

**RQ1:** All four constructs—TPACK, STEM, ESD, and integrative lesson plan quality—showed statistically significant improvement following the PjBL intervention, with uniformly large effect sizes (Cohen's $d > 2.3$) and Medium N-Gain values. TPACK and STEM were the most responsive constructs, while ESD exhibited the weakest N-Gain, with no participant achieving High N-Gain and 28.4% remaining in the Low category.

**RQ2:** Building on these pre-post improvements, PLS-SEM analysis revealed the structural mechanisms underlying these changes. PjBL significantly predicted all three integration dimensions: TPACK ($\beta = 0.727$, $p < .001$), STEM ($\beta = 0.683$, $p < .001$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.617$, $p < .001$), all with large effect sizes ($f^2 > 0.5$). H1 was fully supported.

**RQ3:** Among the three dimensions, TPACK was the most strongly influenced, followed by STEM and ESD. The ranking (TPACK > STEM > ESD) is based on path coefficients and effect sizes, suggesting that PjBL's technology-rich, artifact-creation focus most naturally activates technological pedagogical content knowledge.

**RQ4:** Turning to the outcome side of the model, all three integration dimensions contributed significantly to integrative lesson plan quality with large effect sizes: STEM ($\beta = 0.483$, $f^2 = 5.785$), TPACK ($\beta = 0.420$, $f^2 = 2.987$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.340$, $f^2 = 2.546$). H2 was supported, validating the higher-order construct conceptualization of integrative lesson planning.

**RQ5:** Finally, a full mediation pattern was observed in aggregate: PjBL influenced lesson plan quality not directly but through the enhancement of all three integration competences. All three mediating pathways were significant: STEM (indirect $\beta = 0.330$, VAF $= 37.4\%$), TPACK (indirect $\beta = 0.309$, VAF $= 35.0\%$), and ESD (indirect $\beta = 0.213$, VAF $= 24.1\%$). The total indirect effect was substantial ($\beta = 0.852$, $p < .001$), while the direct effect was non-significant. H3 was fully supported.

### Contributions

The study's principal contribution lies in providing the first empirical test of a structural model that simultaneously positions TPACK, STEM, and ESD as mediating dimensions between PjBL and integrative lesson plan quality. The finding that all three pathways function as significant mediating channels advances the Teacher Design Capacity framework by specifying the compositional pathways through which a pedagogical intervention translates into design competence. Unlike prior research suggesting that some dimensions (e.g., ESD) may not be amenable to PjBL-based development, this study demonstrates that PjBL significantly influences all three dimensions with large effect sizes, though the N-Gain analysis reveals that ESD requires additional scaffolding to maximize absolute gains.

### Future Directions

Future research should address the limitations of this study through several methodological improvements. First, quasi-experimental designs with control groups would enable stronger causal inference. Second, multi-site replication across diverse institutional and cultural contexts would enhance generalizability. Third, extended intervention durations with dedicated ESD scaffolding—such as sustainability-focused driving questions and structured SDG reflection—may yield stronger absolute improvements in ESD competences.

Additionally, mixed-methods studies incorporating qualitative data—such as interviews and classroom observations—would provide richer insight into the mechanisms through which PjBL shapes integrative design thinking. Longitudinal studies tracking the retention of integrative competences beyond the intervention period would further strengthen the evidence base for PjBL's role in pre-service science teacher preparation.

In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that Project-Based Learning is an effective intervention for developing pre-service science teachers' integrative lesson planning competence. The full mediation pattern—operating through TPACK, STEM, and ESD pathways—offers both theoretical insight into how pedagogical interventions translate into design competence and practical guidance for teacher education programs seeking to cultivate multi-dimensional integration skills in future science teachers.
