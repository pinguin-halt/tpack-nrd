## Abstract

Preparing pre-service science teachers to design lesson plans that simultaneously integrate Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM), and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) remains a critical yet under-researched challenge in teacher education. This study examined the effect of Project-Based Learning (PjBL) on the development of these three integration dimensions and overall integrative lesson plan quality, and modeled the structural relationships among them. A pre-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was employed with 95 pre-service science teachers at a public university in Indonesia. Data were collected through rubric-based assessments of lesson plans across 14 indicators and a PjBL implementation quality questionnaire, then analyzed using paired tests, normalized gain (N-Gain) analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with 5,000 bootstrap iterations. All constructs improved significantly following the PjBL intervention, with large effect sizes (Cohen's $d > 2.3$) and Medium N-Gain values; however, ESD exhibited the weakest N-Gain, with no participant reaching High N-Gain. PLS-SEM results revealed that PjBL significantly predicted all three integration dimensions with large effect sizes: TPACK ($\beta = 0.727$, $p < .001$, $f^2 = 1.123$), STEM ($\beta = 0.683$, $p < .001$, $f^2 = 0.872$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.617$, $p < .001$, $f^2 = 0.614$). All three dimensions contributed significantly to integrative lesson plan quality with large effect sizes. A full mediation pattern was observed: PjBL influenced lesson plan quality through the enhancement of all three integration competences, with significant indirect effects via STEM ($\beta = 0.330$), TPACK ($\beta = 0.309$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.213$) pathways. The total indirect effect was substantial ($\beta = 0.852$, $p < .001$), while the direct effect was non-significant. These findings provide the first empirical test of a structural model linking PjBL to integrative lesson planning through TPACK, STEM, and ESD pathways, offering actionable guidance for teacher education institutions seeking to develop comprehensive design competencies in pre-service science teachers.
