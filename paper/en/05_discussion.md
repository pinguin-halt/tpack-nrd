## 5. Discussion

This study examined the influence of Project-Based Learning on pre-service science teachers' integrative lesson planning competence, operationalized through three integration dimensions—TPACK, STEM, and ESD—using a combination of pre-post comparison and PLS-SEM analysis. The findings yield both encouraging evidence and important caveats that merit careful interpretation.

### 5.1 Effectiveness of PjBL in Enhancing Integrative Competence (RQ1)

The pre-post analysis revealed statistically significant improvements across all four constructs, with uniformly large effect sizes (Cohen's $d > 2.3$). These results provide strong evidence that participants' integrative lesson planning competences were substantially higher after the PjBL intervention than before it. The magnitude of improvement is consistent with Dewi et al.'s (2022) finding that PjBL scaffolding models produce meaningful gains in pre-service teachers' TPACK and lesson design abilities, and extends this evidence by demonstrating that gains are not confined to technology integration but extend to STEM and ESD dimensions as well.

The N-Gain analysis, however, reveals an important pattern of differential responsiveness. TPACK ($M = 0.596$) and STEM ($M = 0.574$) achieved the highest normalized gains, both approaching the upper boundary of the Medium category. RPP Integratif ($M = 0.513$) fell in the mid-range of Medium. ESD exhibited the lowest N-Gain ($M = 0.376$), barely exceeding the Medium threshold, with no participant achieving a High gain and 28.4% remaining in the Low category.

This differential pattern is educationally meaningful. The relatively strong gains in TPACK and STEM likely reflect the natural alignment between PjBL's structural elements and these competences. PjBL's emphasis on artifact creation inherently requires technology integration (activating TPACK), and its driving questions typically span multiple STEM disciplines, facilitating interdisciplinary thinking. In contrast, ESD competences—particularly the capacity to embed sustainability perspectives, inquiry-based environmental investigation, and evaluative reasoning about socio-scientific issues—require a form of pedagogical reorientation that may not emerge organically from a general PjBL experience. Purwianingsih et al. (2022) observed a similar pattern, noting that integrating ESD into pre-service teachers' TPACK required a structured, dedicated program rather than incidental exposure. The present findings suggest that while PjBL provides a fertile context for ESD development, explicit scaffolding—such as sustainability-focused driving questions, structured reflection on SDG connections, or dedicated ESD design criteria—may be necessary to push ESD gains beyond the Medium threshold.

Recent evidence supports this interpretation. Studies on PBL-STEM lesson design in pre-service cohorts consistently report stronger short-term gains in interdisciplinary design and technology-enabled planning than in sustainability-oriented action competence, unless ESD is intentionally embedded in the design task architecture (Pitot et al., 2024; Portillo-Blanco et al., 2025; Vidal & Kuckuck, 2025). Likewise, sustainability-focused teacher preparation studies show that ESD competence growth is more robust when reflection and community-linked sustainability tasks are explicitly engineered into coursework (Singh-Pillay, 2023; Ozdemir-Yilmazer, 2025).

This pattern also fits broader evidence on PBL implementation in science contexts: teachers often implement visible PBL elements (collaboration, artefact production, presentation, reflection) more readily than deeper student-driven components, which may partly explain why ESD-oriented reasoning develops more slowly without explicit design support (Markula & Aksela, 2022).

It should be noted that the absence of a control group precludes attributing the observed improvements solely to the PjBL intervention. Maturation effects, concurrent coursework, and testing effects (pretest sensitization) remain plausible alternative explanations. The large effect sizes mitigate this concern somewhat—gains of this magnitude are unlikely to result from maturation alone over a single semester—but causal claims must remain tentative pending replication with quasi-experimental designs.

### 5.2 PjBL as a Driver of Integration Dimensions (RQ2)

Having established the overall effectiveness of the intervention, we now turn to the structural relationships that explain how PjBL influences these competences. The PLS-SEM analysis revealed that PjBL exerted statistically significant and strong positive effects on all three integration dimensions: TPACK ($\beta = 0.727$, $p < .001$), STEM ($\beta = 0.683$, $p < .001$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.617$, $p < .001$). All effect sizes were large ($f^2 > 0.35$), indicating substantial practical significance. The direct path from PjBL to RPP was not significant ($\beta = 0.030$, $p = .441$). These findings fully support H1: PjBL significantly influences all three integration dimensions.

The strong PjBL $\rightarrow$ TPACK path ($\beta = 0.727$) is theoretically coherent. PjBL's core elements—authentic driving questions, collaborative investigation, and artifact creation—naturally require pre-service teachers to consider how technology can support pedagogical goals and content delivery. This finding extends Mansour et al.'s (2024) SEM study in Qatar, which found significant relationships between pedagogical approaches and TPACK integration. The large effect size ($f^2 = 1.123$) suggests that PjBL is particularly effective in developing technology integration competences.

This interpretation is also consistent with recent intervention studies showing that structured technology implementation in pre-service science teacher education improves both TPACK and technology-related behavioral orientations, indicating that pedagogical design tasks can simultaneously strengthen knowledge and enactment readiness (Stinken-Rosner et al., 2023; Gurer & Akkaya, 2021).

Similarly, the significant PjBL $\rightarrow$ STEM path ($\beta = 0.683$, $f^2 = 0.872$) confirms that PjBL's interdisciplinary nature activates STEM reasoning. When designing lesson plans through a PjBL process, participants must consider how science content connects to engineering design challenges, how technology supports data collection and analysis, and how mathematical reasoning informs problem-solving. This alignment between PjBL's structural demands and STEM integration explains the strong relationship.

The significant PjBL $\rightarrow$ ESD path ($\beta = 0.617$, $f^2 = 0.614$) is a notable finding that diverges from the N-Gain pattern. While ESD showed the weakest N-Gain in the pre-post analysis, the structural model reveals that variation in PjBL implementation quality significantly predicts variation in ESD competence in the posttest data. This apparent divergence can be reconciled by recognizing that the pre-post analysis measures absolute improvement from a lower baseline, while the SEM examines structural relationships at posttest. The findings suggest that PjBL does influence ESD development structurally, but the absolute gains may be constrained by the lower starting point and the greater pedagogical distance between PjBL's general structure and ESD-specific competences.

Overall, PjBL explained substantial variance in all three integration dimensions: 52.9% in TPACK, 46.6% in STEM, and 38.0% in ESD. These moderate-to-substantial $R^2$ values indicate that PjBL, as the sole exogenous predictor, captures a meaningful proportion of factors influencing integration competences. The remaining unexplained variance is likely attributable to other factors—such as prior content knowledge, digital literacy, teaching self-efficacy, beliefs about sustainability, and metacognitive skills—that were not included in the model.

### 5.3 The Most Responsive Integration Dimension (RQ3)

Building on the RQ2 findings that all three dimensions were significantly influenced by PjBL, RQ3 asked which dimension was most responsive. The comparative analysis ranked TPACK as the most strongly influenced dimension ($\beta = 0.727$, $f^2 = 1.123$), followed by STEM ($\beta = 0.683$, $f^2 = 0.872$) and ESD ($\beta = 0.617$, $f^2 = 0.614$). This ranking (TPACK > STEM > ESD) is based on path coefficients and effect sizes from the structural model. All three paths were significant with large effect sizes, indicating that PjBL is an effective intervention for developing all three dimensions, with TPACK showing the strongest structural relationship.

The practical significance of this ranking lies in its curricular implications. The finding that TPACK integration is the dimension most strongly influenced by PjBL suggests that PjBL's technology-rich, artifact-creation focus naturally activates technological pedagogical content knowledge. Teacher education programs can leverage PjBL as a primary vehicle for TPACK competence development while designing supplementary interventions for dimensions that require additional support.

At the same time, the ranking aligns with lesson-planning research showing that pre-service teachers tend to progress first in planning structure, tool integration, and disciplinary coherence, while more complex justice- or sustainability-oriented design considerations typically develop with additional scaffolding and iterative feedback cycles (Karlstrom & Hamza, 2021; Beckmann & Ehmke, 2023; Davis & Bautista, 2024).

### 5.4 Dimensions as Constituents of Integrative Lesson Plan Quality (RQ4)

Whereas RQ3 examined which dimension was most responsive to PjBL, RQ4 turns to the outcome side of the model: how do these dimensions contribute to integrative lesson plan quality? All three integration dimensions contributed significantly and substantially to integrative lesson plan quality, with consistently large effect sizes: STEM ($\beta = 0.484$, $f^2 = 5.444$), TPACK ($\beta = 0.425$, $f^2 = 2.783$), and ESD ($\beta = 0.345$, $f^2 = 2.399$). This finding supports H2 and validates the conceptualization of integrative lesson planning as a higher-order competence constituted by three distinct but complementary dimensions.

The large $f^2$ values (all exceeding 2.5) indicate that each dimension makes a substantial, non-redundant contribution to lesson plan quality. This is theoretically significant for the Teacher Design Capacity framework (Brown, 2009; McKenney et al., 2015): it suggests that integrative lesson planning competence cannot be reduced to proficiency in a single dimension but requires the coordinated development of technology integration, interdisciplinary reasoning, and sustainability perspectives. Teacher education programs that emphasize only one dimension—for instance, focusing exclusively on TPACK—would be insufficient for developing the full spectrum of integrative design competence.

This argument is coherent with contemporary lesson-planning evidence that frames pre-service teacher planning quality as a composite outcome of multiple knowledge resources and planning decisions rather than a single-domain skill, particularly in science methods contexts (Krepf & Konig, 2022; Tellez-Acosta et al., 2023; Pleasants & Parrish, 2024).

An important methodological caveat applies to these findings. The $R^2$ for RPP was 0.977, an unusually high value that reflects the compositional nature of the construct: RPPInt_total_post is computed as the mean of all TPACK, STEM, and ESD indicator scores, making the three dimensions near-perfect predictors by construction. Consequently, the large $f^2$ values and the high $R^2$ do not solely reflect empirically discovered relationships but partly capture mathematical inevitability. This does not invalidate the conceptual insight—that integrative lesson planning comprises multiple dimensions—but the magnitude of the path coefficients should be interpreted as reflecting the construct's operationalization rather than purely empirical effect magnitudes.

### 5.5 Mediating Role of Integration Dimensions (RQ5)

Having established that PjBL influences all three dimensions (RQ2) and that all three dimensions contribute to lesson plan quality (RQ4), RQ5 examined whether these dimensions mediate the PjBL-to-RPP relationship. The mediation analysis revealed a pattern of full mediation in aggregate: the total indirect effect was significant ($\beta = 0.852$, $p < .001$), while the direct effect of PjBL on RPP was non-significant ($\beta = 0.030$, $p = .441$). This finding supports H3 and offers a key theoretical insight: PjBL does not influence integrative lesson plan quality directly but operates through the enhancement of all three integration competences.

Critically, all three mediating pathways were statistically significant:

- **STEM** was the strongest mediator (indirect $\beta = 0.330$, VAF $= 37.4\%$), confirming that PjBL's influence on lesson plan quality operates substantially through STEM integration competence development.
- **TPACK** was the second strongest mediator (indirect $\beta = 0.309$, VAF $= 35.0\%$), demonstrating that technology integration serves as a significant channel through which PjBL improves lesson planning.
- **ESD** was also a significant mediator (indirect $\beta = 0.213$, VAF $= 24.1\%$), indicating that even though ESD showed the weakest absolute gains in the pre-post analysis, it nonetheless functions as a significant mediating pathway in the structural model.

This finding of three significant mediating pathways advances beyond prior research that found mixed or partial mediation patterns. The full mediation pattern suggests that PjBL works *through* specific skill development rather than through diffuse, unspecified mechanisms (Hair et al., 2022). The significant ESD mediation pathway is particularly noteworthy: while ESD requires additional scaffolding to maximize absolute gains (as indicated by the N-Gain analysis), the structural model confirms that ESD competence development is integral to the mechanism by which PjBL influences lesson plan quality.

From a teacher-learning perspective, this mechanism-focused interpretation is consistent with studies of pre-service planning development showing that intervention effects are typically realized through intermediate competence shifts (e.g., planning knowledge, pedagogical reasoning, and reflective design moves) before appearing in holistic planning quality indicators (Karlstrom & Hamza, 2021; Beckmann & Ehmke, 2023).

### 5.6 Theoretical Implications

The preceding findings have several implications for theory. First, this study provides the first empirical test of a structural model that positions TPACK, STEM, and ESD as simultaneous mediating dimensions between PjBL and integrative lesson plan quality. The full mediation pattern—with all three pathways significant—suggests that theoretical models of teacher design capacity (Brown, 2009) should specify the compositional pathways through which interventions influence design competence, rather than treating design capacity as a unitary outcome of pedagogical experience.

Second, the study reveals that all three integration dimensions are significantly influenced by PjBL, contradicting the assumption that some dimensions (e.g., ESD) are not amenable to PjBL-based development. The strong path coefficients (all $\beta > 0.6$) and large effect sizes ($f^2 > 0.5$) demonstrate that PjBL can serve as a comprehensive intervention for developing multiple integration competences simultaneously.

Third, the study validates the operationalization of integrative lesson planning as a construct that is constituted by—rather than merely correlated with—TPACK, STEM, and ESD competences. The consistent significance and large effect sizes of all three dimensional paths provide empirical grounding for the higher-order construct conceptualization.

This also resonates with recent cross-curricular sustainability studies in teacher education, which emphasize that holistic lesson quality emerges when technological, disciplinary, and sustainability logics are planned together rather than sequentially (Ozdemir-Yilmazer, 2025; Vidal & Kuckuck, 2025).

### 5.7 Practical Implications

Beyond theoretical contributions, the findings offer actionable guidance for teacher education programs (Lembaga Pendidikan Tenaga Kependidikan, LPTK). First, PjBL should be adopted as a core pedagogical strategy in science teacher preparation courses, given its demonstrated capacity to enhance all three integration competences with large effect sizes. The strong structural relationships ($\beta > 0.6$ for all dimensions) confirm that PjBL is an effective vehicle for developing TPACK, STEM, and ESD competences.

Second, while PjBL is effective for all dimensions, the N-Gain analysis reveals that ESD shows the weakest absolute gains. This suggests that explicit ESD scaffolding should complement the PjBL experience to maximize ESD development. Such scaffolding might include sustainability-focused driving questions, structured reflection on SDG connections, or dedicated ESD design criteria within the PjBL process.

Third, the rubric-based assessment approach used in this study offers a practical tool for evaluating pre-service teachers' integrative lesson plan quality. The 14-indicator rubric spanning TPACK (7 items), STEM (4 items), and ESD (3 items) can be adopted or adapted by teacher education institutions seeking to assess multi-dimensional design competence through authentic performance tasks rather than self-report measures.

Fourth, the mediation findings suggest that all three integration dimensions are necessary channels through which PjBL influences lesson plan quality. Teacher educators should ensure that PjBL activities address all three dimensions rather than focusing narrowly on one or two.

In practical curriculum terms, this implies designing project briefs, planning templates, and feedback rubrics that explicitly require evidence of technology-pedagogy alignment, interdisciplinary STEM coherence, and sustainability reasoning in each lesson prototype (Pitot et al., 2024; Tellez-Acosta et al., 2023; Portillo-Blanco et al., 2025).

### 5.8 Limitations

Several limitations constrain the interpretation and generalizability of these findings.

*Design limitations.* The pre-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design lacks a control group, precluding unambiguous causal attribution. Observed improvements may be partly explained by maturation, concurrent coursework, or testing effects. Future studies should employ quasi-experimental designs with comparison groups.

*Measurement quality.* The TPACK construct (AVE $= 0.418$) and STEM construct (AVE $= 0.480$) fell below the 0.50 AVE threshold, though their composite reliabilities were acceptable (CR $> 0.80$). The PjBL construct exhibited good measurement quality (AVE $= 0.687$, CR $= 0.917$, $\alpha = 0.886$) using all five indicators (PjBL01-05). Indicators with loadings between 0.40 and 0.70 were retained following Hair et al.'s (2022) recommendation for exploratory research.

*Construct operationalization.* The RPP Integratif construct was operationalized as a single indicator (RPPInt_total_post), which is the arithmetic mean of all TPACK, STEM, and ESD indicator scores. This compositional operationalization produces a mechanistically high $R^2$ (0.977) for the RPP construct. Alternative operationalizations—such as independent holistic ratings of lesson plan quality by external evaluators—would provide a more stringent test of the model.

*Sample and generalizability.* All participants were drawn from a single teacher education institution, limiting generalizability to other institutional and cultural contexts. The sample size ($N = 95$), while exceeding the minimum requirements for PLS-SEM, is modest for the complexity of the model. Replication across multiple institutions and with larger samples would strengthen the evidence base.

*Intervention scope.* While PjBL significantly influenced all three dimensions, the N-Gain analysis suggests that ESD gains were weaker in absolute terms. Longer interventions with explicit ESD scaffolding may yield stronger absolute improvements in ESD competences.

This limitation is in line with the broader ESD teacher-education literature, which indicates that short-cycle interventions can raise awareness and planning intent, but deeper ESD action competence usually requires longer, iterative, and context-embedded preparation models (Singh-Pillay, 2023; Vidal & Kuckuck, 2025).

Despite these limitations, the study provides a coherent and empirically grounded test of the integrative model. The convergence between the pre-post findings (RQ1) and the SEM findings (RQ2--RQ5) strengthens confidence in the overall pattern of results, particularly the finding that PjBL significantly influences all three integration dimensions through a full mediation mechanism.
