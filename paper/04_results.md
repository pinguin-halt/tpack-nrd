## 4. Results

### 4.1 Descriptive Statistics

Prior to hypothesis testing, we examined the descriptive statistics for all constructs. Table 1 presents the construct-level means and standard deviations at pretest and posttest, while Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of these changes.

**Table 1.** Descriptive Statistics per Construct (Pretest vs. Posttest)

| Construct | *N* | Pre *M* | Pre *SD* | Post *M* | Post *SD* | *M*_diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TPACK | 95 | 2.306 | 0.390 | 3.319 | 0.294 | 1.013 |
| STEM | 95 | 2.172 | 0.393 | 3.222 | 0.378 | 1.051 |
| ESD | 95 | 1.929 | 0.328 | 2.726 | 0.259 | 0.798 |
| RPP Integratif | 95 | 2.136 | 0.256 | 3.089 | 0.237 | 0.954 |

*Note.* Scale range: 1--4. RPP Integratif = grand mean of all 14 indicators.

As shown in Table 1, all constructs exhibited substantial increases following the PjBL intervention. The largest mean difference was observed for STEM (*M*_diff = 1.051), followed by TPACK (*M*_diff = 1.013), RPP Integratif (*M*_diff = 0.954), and ESD (*M*_diff = 0.798). Standard deviations generally decreased from pretest to posttest, indicating that participants' competences became more homogeneous after the intervention.

To provide a more granular view, Table 2 presents the indicator-level descriptive statistics.

**Table 2.** Descriptive Statistics per Indicator

| Indicator | Pre *M* | Pre *SD* | Post *M* | Post *SD* | *M*_diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TK | 2.018 | 0.540 | 3.192 | 0.476 | 1.174 |
| PK | 2.667 | 0.503 | 3.543 | 0.355 | 0.876 |
| CK | 2.441 | 0.758 | 3.376 | 0.397 | 0.936 |
| TPK | 2.079 | 0.586 | 3.183 | 0.493 | 1.105 |
| TCK | 2.131 | 0.580 | 3.186 | 0.480 | 1.055 |
| PCK | 2.740 | 0.634 | 3.587 | 0.318 | 0.848 |
| TPACK | 2.068 | 0.531 | 3.166 | 0.606 | 1.099 |
| Science | 2.448 | 0.581 | 3.390 | 0.345 | 0.943 |
| Technology | 2.193 | 0.597 | 3.338 | 0.499 | 1.145 |
| Engineering | 2.370 | 0.578 | 3.230 | 0.454 | 0.860 |
| Mathematics | 1.677 | 0.598 | 2.932 | 0.760 | 1.255 |
| ESD-PCK | 1.895 | 0.416 | 2.686 | 0.315 | 0.792 |
| ESD-INQ | 1.972 | 0.425 | 2.726 | 0.305 | 0.754 |
| ESD-EVA | 1.919 | 0.470 | 2.767 | 0.293 | 0.848 |

At the indicator level (Table 2), the pattern was consistent across dimensions. Within TPACK, the largest gains occurred for TK (*M*_diff = 1.174) and TPK (*M*_diff = 1.105), reflecting heightened technology-related integration. Within STEM, Mathematics showed the greatest improvement (*M*_diff = 1.255), while Science showed the smallest (*M*_diff = 0.943). ESD indicators improved relatively uniformly, with ESD-EVA exhibiting the highest gain (*M*_diff = 0.848).

Having established that substantial improvements occurred across all constructs, we now turn to formal hypothesis testing to determine whether these changes were statistically significant.

### 4.2 RQ1: Pre-Post Changes

#### Normality Testing

Before conducting paired comparisons, we assessed the normality of difference scores using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Table 3 summarizes the results.

**Table 3.** Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test Results for Difference Scores

| Construct | *W* | *p* | Normal |
|---|---|---|---|
| TPACK | 0.968 | .020 | No |
| STEM | 0.977 | .088 | Yes |
| ESD | 0.990 | .704 | Yes |
| RPP Integratif | 0.986 | .418 | Yes |

As shown in Table 3, difference scores for STEM (*W* = 0.977, *p* = .088), ESD (*W* = 0.990, *p* = .704), and RPP Integratif (*W* = 0.986, *p* = .418) were normally distributed (*p* > .05). However, the TPACK difference scores departed significantly from normality (*W* = 0.968, *p* = .020). Accordingly, the paired-samples t-test was applied to STEM, ESD, and RPP Integratif, while the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for TPACK.

#### Paired Tests and Effect Sizes

With appropriate tests selected based on normality, we proceeded to evaluate the statistical significance and practical importance of the pre-post changes. Table 4 presents the paired test results and effect sizes.

**Table 4.** Paired Test Results

| Construct | Test | Statistic | *p* | Cohen's *d* | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TPACK | Wilcoxon | *W* = 0.0 | < .001 | 2.705 | Large |
| STEM | Paired t | *t*(94) = 25.90 | < .001 | 2.657 | Large |
| ESD | Paired t | *t*(94) = 22.79 | < .001 | 2.338 | Large |
| RPP Integratif | Paired t | *t*(94) = 40.88 | < .001 | 4.194 | Large |

*Note.* Wilcoxon W = 0.0 indicates all participants improved; Cohen's d for TPACK computed from means and pooled SD.

As Table 4 demonstrates, all four constructs exhibited statistically significant improvements from pretest to posttest (*p* < .001). Effect sizes were uniformly large, with Cohen's *d* values exceeding 2.3 for all constructs. The largest effect size was observed for RPP Integratif (*d* = 4.194), reflecting the highly consistent nature of improvement across all integration indicators combined.

#### Normalized Gain

Beyond statistical significance and effect sizes, we calculated normalized gain (N-Gain) to quantify the proportion of maximum possible improvement achieved. Table 5 presents the N-Gain summary, while Figure 2 visualizes the distribution of gain categories across constructs.

**Table 5.** N-Gain Summary

| Construct | N-Gain *M* | *SD* | Category | High (%) | Medium (%) | Low (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TPACK | 0.596 | 0.160 | Medium | 26.3 | 72.6 | 1.1 |
| STEM | 0.574 | 0.179 | Medium | 24.2 | 69.5 | 6.3 |
| ESD | 0.376 | 0.129 | Medium | 0.0 | 71.6 | 28.4 |
| RPP Integratif | 0.513 | 0.103 | Medium | 3.2 | 95.8 | 1.1 |

As shown in Table 5, all constructs achieved Medium gain (0.3--0.7). TPACK obtained the highest mean N-Gain (*M* = 0.596, *SD* = 0.160), followed by STEM (*M* = 0.574, *SD* = 0.179), RPP Integratif (*M* = 0.513, *SD* = 0.103), and ESD (*M* = 0.376, *SD* = 0.129).

The distribution of individual N-Gain categories, illustrated in Figure 2, revealed notable differences across constructs. TPACK and STEM each had approximately one-quarter of participants achieving High gains (26.3% and 24.2%, respectively). In contrast, no participant achieved a High N-Gain for ESD, and 28.4% of participants remained in the Low category—the highest proportion of Low-gain participants among all constructs. This pattern suggests that ESD competences were less responsive to the PjBL intervention compared to TPACK and STEM.

![Figure 2. Distribution of N-Gain Categories by Construct](../outputs/rm1/fig2_ngain_distribution.png)

*Figure 2.* Distribution of N-Gain categories (High, Medium, Low) by construct. ESD exhibited no High-gain participants and the highest proportion of Low-gain participants.

In summary, the pre-post analysis (RQ1) demonstrated that PjBL significantly improved all four constructs with large effect sizes, though ESD showed the smallest gains. To understand the structural relationships among these constructs, we now turn to the PLS-SEM analysis addressing RQ2--RQ5.

### 4.3 RQ2--RQ5: PLS-SEM Analysis

#### Measurement Model Evaluation

Before testing the structural hypotheses, we evaluated the measurement model to ensure adequate reliability and validity. Table 6 presents the outer loadings for all indicators.

**Table 6.** Outer Loadings

| Construct | Indicator | Loading | >= 0.708 |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESD | ESD-EVA | 0.780 | Yes |
| ESD | ESD-INQ | 0.894 | Yes |
| ESD | ESD-PCK | 0.867 | Yes |
| PjBL | PjBL01 | 0.811 | Yes |
| PjBL | PjBL02 | 0.834 | Yes |
| PjBL | PjBL03 | 0.847 | Yes |
| PjBL | PjBL04 | 0.857 | Yes |
| TPACK | TK | 0.690 | No |
| TPACK | PK | 0.224 | No |
| TPACK | CK | 0.673 | No |
| TPACK | TPK | 0.760 | Yes |
| TPACK | TCK | 0.795 | Yes |
| TPACK | PCK | 0.401 | No |
| TPACK | TPACK_int | 0.758 | Yes |
| STEM | Science | 0.485 | No |
| STEM | Technology | 0.716 | Yes |
| STEM | Engineering | 0.578 | No |
| STEM | Mathematics | 0.914 | Yes |
| RPP | RPPInt_total | 1.000 | Yes |

*Note.* Indicators with loadings between 0.40 and 0.70 were retained following Hair et al.'s (2022) recommendation for exploratory research.

As shown in Table 6, all ESD indicators exceeded the 0.708 threshold, with ESD-INQ exhibiting the highest loading (0.894). All PjBL indicators (PjBL01--PjBL04) exceeded the threshold, with loadings ranging from 0.811 to 0.857. Among TPACK indicators, three met the threshold (TPK = 0.760, TCK = 0.795, TPACK = 0.758), while TK (0.690), CK (0.673), PK (0.224), and PCK (0.401) fell below it. For STEM, M_post (0.914) and T_post (0.716) met the threshold, while S_post (0.485) and E_post (0.578) did not. The RPP construct, operationalized as a single indicator, had a fixed loading of 1.000.

Building on the indicator-level results, Table 7 reports the construct-level reliability and validity indices.

**Table 7.** Construct Reliability and Convergent Validity

| Construct | AVE | CR | Cronbach's alpha |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESD | 0.720 | 0.886 | 0.807 |
| PjBL | 0.701 | 0.904 | 0.857 |
| RPP | 1.000 | 1.000 | — |
| STEM | 0.480 | 0.814 | 0.694 |
| TPACK | 0.418 | 0.834 | 0.766 |

*Note.* Thresholds: AVE >= 0.50, CR >= 0.70, alpha >= 0.70. RPP is a single-indicator construct.

As Table 7 indicates, ESD met all criteria (AVE = 0.720, CR = 0.886, alpha = 0.807). PjBL exhibited excellent measurement quality (AVE = 0.701, CR = 0.904, alpha = 0.857), meeting all standard thresholds. TPACK exhibited adequate composite reliability (CR = 0.834) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.766), though its AVE (0.418) fell below the 0.50 threshold. STEM showed a borderline AVE (0.480) with acceptable CR (0.814).

Finally, discriminant validity was assessed via the HTMT ratio, as presented in Table 7b.

**Table 7b.** Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) Ratio Matrix

| | PjBL | TPACK | STEM | ESD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PjBL | — | | | |
| TPACK | 0.846 | — | | |
| STEM | 0.876 | 0.770 | — | |
| ESD | 0.726 | 0.298 | 0.456 | — |

*Note.* All values < 0.90, supporting discriminant validity.

All pairwise HTMT values were below 0.90 (Henseler et al., 2015), supporting discriminant validity. The highest HTMT was observed for the PjBL--STEM pair (0.876), indicating substantial but distinguishable correlation. With adequate measurement properties established, we proceeded to evaluate the structural model.

#### Structural Model: Direct Effects (RQ2)

Having confirmed the measurement model, we examined the structural relationships to address RQ2. Table 8 presents the path coefficients, bootstrap statistics, and effect sizes for all direct paths.

**Table 8.** Structural Model — Path Coefficients and Significance

| Path | beta | SE | *t* | *p* | 95% CI | Sig. | *f*^2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PjBL -> TPACK | 0.718 | 0.053 | 13.561 | < .001 | [0.606, 0.811] | Yes | 1.063 (L) |
| PjBL -> STEM | 0.671 | 0.056 | 11.987 | < .001 | [0.558, 0.775] | Yes | 0.820 (L) |
| PjBL -> ESD | 0.612 | 0.065 | 9.454 | < .001 | [0.482, 0.733] | Yes | 0.598 (L) |
| PjBL -> RPP | 0.040 | 0.042 | 1.025 | .305 | [-0.038, 0.127] | No | 0.015 (N) |
| TPACK -> RPP | 0.420 | 0.036 | 11.645 | < .001 | [0.343, 0.483] | Yes | 2.987 (L) |
| STEM -> RPP | 0.483 | 0.036 | 13.503 | < .001 | [0.414, 0.553] | Yes | 5.785 (L) |
| ESD -> RPP | 0.340 | 0.040 | 8.464 | < .001 | [0.261, 0.417] | Yes | 2.546 (L) |

*Note.* L = Large, N = Negligible. Bootstrap: 5,000 iterations, seed = 42.

As shown in Table 8, PjBL exerted significant positive effects on all three integration dimensions: TPACK (beta = 0.718, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 1.063), STEM (beta = 0.671, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 0.820), and ESD (beta = 0.612, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 0.598). All effect sizes were large. Notably, the direct path from PjBL to RPP was not significant (beta = 0.040, *p* = .305), suggesting that PjBL does not directly influence lesson plan quality but operates through the mediating constructs.

Furthermore, all three integration dimensions exerted strong, significant effects on RPP quality: STEM showed the largest coefficient (beta = 0.483, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 5.785), followed by TPACK (beta = 0.420, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 2.987) and ESD (beta = 0.340, *p* < .001, *f*^2 = 2.546). All three *f*^2 values exceeded the large-effect threshold of 0.35.

The model explained 97.8% of variance in RPP (R^2 = 0.978), 51.5% in TPACK (R^2 = 0.515), 45.1% in STEM (R^2 = 0.451), and 37.4% in ESD (R^2 = 0.374). The very high R^2 for RPP reflects the fact that RPPInt_total_post is computed as a composite of the TPACK, STEM, and ESD indicator scores, making the three dimensions near-perfect predictors by construction. The moderate-to-substantial R^2 values for TPACK, STEM, and ESD indicate that PjBL explains substantial variance in all three integration dimensions.

Predictive relevance (Q^2) was positive and substantial for all endogenous constructs: RPP (0.975), TPACK (0.493), STEM (0.411), and ESD (0.345), indicating strong predictive capacity beyond simple mean prediction.

#### Comparative Analysis: Dominant Dimension (RQ3)

Building on the RQ2 findings, RQ3 asked which integration dimension was most responsive to PjBL. Table 9 compares the PjBL-to-dimension path coefficients, and Figure 3 visualizes these relationships.

**Table 9.** RQ3 — Comparison of PjBL-to-Dimension Path Coefficients

| Rank | Dimension | beta | *t* | *p* | *f*^2 | Significant |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TPACK | 0.718 | 13.561 | < .001 | 1.063 | Yes |
| 2 | STEM | 0.671 | 11.987 | < .001 | 0.820 | Yes |
| 3 | ESD | 0.612 | 9.454 | < .001 | 0.598 | Yes |

As Table 9 shows, TPACK emerged as the most responsive dimension (beta = 0.718, *f*^2 = 1.063), followed by STEM (beta = 0.671, *f*^2 = 0.820) and ESD (beta = 0.612, *f*^2 = 0.598). All paths were significant with large effect sizes, yielding the ranking: TPACK > STEM > ESD.

![Figure 3. Path Coefficients from PjBL to Mediating Constructs](../outputs/rm2_rm5/fig3_sem_rm3_paths.png)

*Figure 3.* Path coefficients from PjBL to each integration dimension (TPACK, STEM, ESD). All paths were significant (*p* < .001) with large effect sizes. TPACK was most responsive to PjBL (beta = 0.718), followed by STEM (beta = 0.671) and ESD (beta = 0.612).

#### Higher-Order Construct: Dimensions Contributing to RPP Quality (RQ4)

Whereas RQ3 examined PjBL's differential effects on the three dimensions, RQ4 focuses on how these dimensions contribute to integrative lesson plan quality. Figure 4 illustrates the full structural model with paths from PjBL through the mediating constructs to RPP.

![Figure 4. Predictors of Integrative Lesson Plan Quality](../outputs/rm2_rm5/fig4_sem_full_model_hoc_proxy.png)

*Figure 4.* Path coefficients from integration dimensions to RPP quality. All three dimensions contributed significantly: STEM (beta = 0.483), TPACK (beta = 0.420), and ESD (beta = 0.340). The direct path from PjBL to RPP was non-significant (beta = 0.040, dashed line).

As shown in Figure 4 and Table 8, all three integration dimensions contributed significantly and substantially to integrative lesson plan quality. STEM was the strongest contributor (beta = 0.483), followed by TPACK (beta = 0.420) and ESD (beta = 0.340). The consistently large *f*^2 values (all > 2.5) demonstrate that each dimension makes a meaningful, non-redundant contribution to overall lesson plan quality. This supports the conceptualization of integrative lesson planning as a higher-order competence constituted by three distinct but complementary design dimensions.

#### Mediation Analysis (RQ5)

Finally, RQ5 examined whether TPACK, STEM, and ESD mediate the relationship between PjBL and RPP quality. Table 10 presents the mediation analysis results, and Figure 5 visualizes the specific indirect effects.

**Table 10.** Mediation Analysis — Indirect Effects

| Indirect Path | beta_indirect | SE | *t* | *p* | 95% CI | VAF | Sobel *z* | Sobel *p* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PjBL -> TPACK -> RPP | 0.301 | 0.034 | 8.840 | < .001 | [0.235, 0.364] | 34.5% | 8.882 | < .001 |
| PjBL -> STEM -> RPP | 0.324 | 0.033 | 9.825 | < .001 | [0.265, 0.395] | 37.1% | 8.918 | < .001 |
| PjBL -> ESD -> RPP | 0.208 | 0.031 | 6.642 | < .001 | [0.148, 0.270] | 23.8% | 6.362 | < .001 |
| Total indirect | 0.833 | 0.038 | 21.919 | < .001 | [0.756, 0.905] | — | — | — |
| Direct (PjBL -> RPP) | 0.040 | 0.042 | 1.025 | .305 | [-0.038, 0.127] | — | — | — |
| Total effect | 0.873 | 0.023 | 38.027 | < .001 | [0.822, 0.913] | — | — | — |

As Table 10 demonstrates, all three indirect paths were statistically significant based on bootstrap confidence intervals:

- **PjBL -> STEM -> RPP** was the strongest mediating pathway (indirect beta = 0.324, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.265, 0.395]). The VAF of 37.1% indicates partial mediation, and the Sobel test confirmed significance (*z* = 8.918, *p* < .001).
- **PjBL -> TPACK -> RPP** yielded a significant indirect effect (indirect beta = 0.301, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.235, 0.364]). The VAF of 34.5% is consistent with partial mediation, and the Sobel test confirmed significance (*z* = 8.882, *p* < .001).
- **PjBL -> ESD -> RPP** was also significant (indirect beta = 0.208, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.148, 0.270]). The VAF of 23.8% indicates partial mediation, and the Sobel test confirmed significance (*z* = 6.362, *p* < .001).

![Figure 5. Specific Indirect Effects via Mediating Constructs](../outputs/rm2_rm5/fig5_sem_mediation_paths.png)

*Figure 5.* Specific indirect effects of PjBL on RPP via each mediating construct. STEM mediated the largest portion (beta_indirect = 0.324), followed by TPACK (beta_indirect = 0.301) and ESD (beta_indirect = 0.208). All indirect paths were significant (*p* < .001).

The total indirect effect was significant (beta = 0.833, *p* < .001), while the direct effect of PjBL on RPP was non-significant (beta = 0.040, *p* = .305). This pattern is consistent with full mediation in aggregate: PjBL influences integrative lesson plan quality not directly, but through the enhancement of all three integration dimensions. The total effect of PjBL on RPP was significant (beta = 0.873, *p* < .001), confirming that the overall influence of PjBL on lesson plan quality is substantial and operates through the mediating dimensions.
