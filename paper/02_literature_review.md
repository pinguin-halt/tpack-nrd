## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Project-Based Learning in Teacher Education

Project-Based Learning (PjBL) is an instructional approach organized around authentic, complex questions that drive sustained investigation, collaborative inquiry, and the creation of tangible artifacts (Krajcik & Shin, 2014). In teacher education contexts, PjBL assumes a dual function: it simultaneously serves as a pedagogical strategy that pre-service teachers experience as learners and as a design methodology they must learn to employ as future practitioners. This dual positioning makes PjBL particularly potent for developing teacher design competence, as the process of creating instructional artifacts—such as lesson plans—under PjBL conditions requires the active mobilization and integration of multiple knowledge domains.

The essential elements of PjBL include a driving question anchored in real-world problems, sustained inquiry through investigation and research, collaboration among learners, the creation of publicly shared artifacts, and structured reflection (Bell, 2010; Krajcik & Shin, 2014). When applied to teacher preparation, these elements translate into a design-based pedagogy in which pre-service teachers formulate instructional goals around authentic scientific problems, investigate content and pedagogical strategies, collaboratively design lesson plans, engage in peer review and revision, and reflect on the coherence and quality of their designs.

Empirical evidence supports PjBL's effectiveness in developing various dimensions of teacher competence. Dewi et al. (2022) demonstrated that a PjBL scaffolding model significantly enhanced pre-service science teachers' TPACK and lesson design abilities, with the scaffolding structure proving essential for guiding novice designers through the complexity of technology-integrated lesson planning. Novallyan and Nehru (2025) found that optimizing teacher profession courses through project methods improved biology education students' pedagogical competencies. Akbulut and Oner (2021) reported that PjBL experiences enhanced pre-service teachers' technology-related competencies. Collectively, these studies establish PjBL as a viable intervention for improving specific dimensions of teacher competence, though none has examined PjBL's simultaneous influence on multiple integration dimensions within a structural model.

### 2.2 Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)

The TPACK framework, introduced by Mishra and Koehler (2006) and grounded in Shulman's (1986) seminal construct of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), articulates the intersecting knowledge domains required for effective technology-enhanced teaching. TPACK comprises seven components: Technology Knowledge (TK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Content Knowledge (CK), and their pairwise intersections—Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)—culminating in the integrative core of TPACK itself, which represents the knowledge needed to teach specific content with appropriate technologies using suitable pedagogical strategies.

For pre-service science teachers, TPACK development is critical because science instruction increasingly relies on digital tools for simulation, data collection, visualization, and collaborative inquiry. The measurement of TPACK has evolved from self-report surveys toward performance-based assessments, including rubric-evaluated lesson plans that capture the enacted integration of technology, pedagogy, and content (Offermann et al., 2025). This performance-based approach is adopted in the present study, where TPACK indicators are assessed through the quality of lesson plan components rather than through self-perceived knowledge.

Recent structural equation modeling studies have examined TPACK in relation to other constructs. Mansour et al. (2024) investigated TPACK integration within STEM education contexts in Qatar, finding significant structural relationships between TPACK components and STEM teaching efficacy. Salleh et al. (2025) explored TPACK development trajectories among pre-service teachers, identifying content knowledge and technological self-efficacy as key predictors. These studies provide methodological precedent for the SEM approach adopted here while highlighting the gap that TPACK has rarely been modeled alongside STEM and ESD within a single structural framework.

### 2.3 STEM Education and Integrative Lesson Design

STEM education, conceptualized as the purposeful integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, has gained substantial traction as both an educational philosophy and a curricular framework (Kelley & Knowles, 2016). The distinction between disciplinary STEM instruction—where subjects are taught separately—and integrative STEM education—where disciplinary boundaries are deliberately crossed to address complex problems—is consequential for lesson plan design. Integrative STEM instruction requires teachers to design learning experiences that embed engineering design processes, mathematical reasoning, and technological applications within science content, a demanding design task that novice teachers often struggle to accomplish.

Kelley and Knowles (2016) proposed a conceptual framework for integrated STEM education that emphasizes situated learning, engineering design as a pedagogical strategy, scientific inquiry as a knowledge-building process, and mathematical thinking as an analytical foundation. Within this framework, the quality of STEM-integrated lesson plans can be evaluated along four dimensions: the accuracy and depth of science content, the purposeful integration of technology, the presence of engineering design thinking, and the application of mathematical reasoning.

For pre-service science teachers, developing STEM integration competence requires moving beyond disciplinary comfort zones and developing what Tucker et al. (2024) describe as STEM self-efficacy—the confidence and capability to design interdisciplinary learning experiences. The challenge is particularly acute for ESD-related integration, where pre-service teachers must additionally consider sustainability contexts that are less familiar than traditional STEM topics.

### 2.4 Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Science Teaching

Education for Sustainable Development represents a global educational paradigm that seeks to equip learners with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes necessary to address interconnected sustainability challenges (UNESCO, 2017). For science teacher education, ESD introduces specific competences that extend beyond traditional science pedagogy: the ability to connect scientific concepts to sustainability issues (ESD-PCK), to employ inquiry-based approaches for investigating environmental and social challenges (ESD-INQ), and to foster evaluative thinking about socio-scientific dilemmas and trade-offs (ESD-EVA) (UNECE, 2012).

Purwianingsih et al. (2022) developed a program for integrating ESD into prospective biology teachers' TPACK, establishing a theoretical and practical bridge between technology integration and sustainability education. Their work, published in the *Journal of Pendidikan IPA Indonesia (JPII)*, demonstrated that structured integration programs can enhance pre-service teachers' capacity to embed sustainability perspectives within technology-enhanced science lessons. Shumba and Kampamba (2013) further explored ESD-specific pedagogical content knowledge, arguing that teachers require specialized knowledge for translating abstract sustainability concepts into concrete pedagogical actions.

Despite these advances, ESD remains the least developed of the three integration dimensions in teacher education research. Unlike TPACK, which benefits from decades of empirical investigation, and STEM integration, which is supported by substantial policy infrastructure, ESD integration in lesson plan design is still an emerging area. This relative novelty has implications for the present study: ESD competences may require more intensive or prolonged scaffolding than TPACK or STEM competences, and their responsiveness to short-term PjBL interventions may differ accordingly.

### 2.5 Integrative Lesson Planning as Teacher Design Competence

The concept of teacher design capacity, introduced by Brown (2009) and elaborated by McKenney et al. (2015), provides the theoretical anchor for conceptualizing integrative lesson planning as a higher-order professional competence. Brown (2009) argued that effective curriculum use requires teachers to function as designers who actively interpret, adapt, and create instructional materials in response to contextual demands. This design capacity is not a fixed trait but a dynamic competence that develops through engagement with design tasks and feedback.

McKenney et al. (2015) extended this framework by identifying the specific knowledge bases—including technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and subject matter knowledge—that underpin teacher design competence. Their ecological framework positions design knowledge at the intersection of personal knowledge, formal knowledge, and practical experience, suggesting that interventions such as PjBL, which provide structured design experiences, can catalyze the integration of these knowledge bases.

In the present study, integrative lesson planning competence is operationalized as the quality of lesson plans that simultaneously integrate TPACK, STEM, and ESD dimensions. This operationalization positions the integrative lesson plan not as a simple aggregate of component scores but as a higher-order construct (HOC) that reflects the emergent quality arising from the coherent integration of multiple design dimensions. The use of a rubric-based assessment—rather than self-report—ensures that the construct captures demonstrated design competence rather than perceived capability.

### 2.6 Conceptual Framework and Hypothesized Model

Drawing on the foregoing theoretical foundations, the present study proposes a structural model in which PjBL serves as the exogenous construct influencing three first-order endogenous constructs—TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration competences—which in turn contribute to the quality of integrative lesson plans (see Figure 1). The model posits both direct effects (PjBL → TPACK, PjBL → STEM, PjBL → ESD) and indirect effects (PjBL → TPACK/STEM/ESD → Integrative Lesson Plan Quality), with the three integration dimensions hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PjBL and lesson plan quality.

The theoretical justification for each pathway is as follows:

1. **PjBL → TPACK:** PjBL's emphasis on artifact creation and inquiry-based investigation naturally requires the mobilization of technology for content-specific pedagogy (Dewi et al., 2022).
2. **PjBL → STEM:** PjBL's authentic driving questions typically span multiple STEM disciplines, requiring interdisciplinary design thinking (Krajcik & Shin, 2014).
3. **PjBL → ESD:** PjBL's focus on real-world problems creates opportunities for addressing sustainability issues, though the strength of this link may depend on explicit scaffolding (Purwianingsih et al., 2022).
4. **TPACK/STEM/ESD → Integrative Lesson Plan Quality:** Each dimension contributes substantive design elements—technology integration, interdisciplinary connections, and sustainability perspectives—that collectively determine the quality of integrative lesson plans (Brown, 2009; McKenney et al., 2015).
5. **Mediation:** PjBL is hypothesized to influence lesson plan quality not directly but through the enhancement of integration competences, consistent with the view that pedagogical interventions operate by developing specific professional knowledge bases that subsequently manifest in design performance.

This model is tested using PLS-SEM, a variance-based approach appropriate for the study's exploratory-confirmatory purpose, the inclusion of a single-indicator construct (lesson plan quality), and the relatively small sample size (N = 95) (Hair et al., 2022).
