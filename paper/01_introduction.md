## 1. Introduction

The landscape of science education in the twenty-first century demands that teachers possess a multifaceted competence extending well beyond disciplinary content mastery. Science teachers are now expected to design instruction that meaningfully integrates digital technology, fosters interdisciplinary reasoning, and addresses pressing sustainability challenges (UNESCO, 2017; Kelley & Knowles, 2016). This expectation is particularly acute for pre-service science teachers, whose professional preparation must equip them not merely with theoretical knowledge of individual pedagogical frameworks, but with the practical capacity to weave multiple frameworks into coherent lesson plans. Yet, existing teacher education programs often treat these dimensions—Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) integration, and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)—as separate curricular silos, leaving aspiring teachers to navigate the complexity of integrative lesson design largely on their own.

The ability to design integrative lesson plans—lesson plans that simultaneously embed technology-enhanced pedagogy, interdisciplinary STEM connections, and sustainability perspectives—represents a higher-order professional competence that Brown (2009) termed *teacher design capacity*. This capacity is not a sum of isolated skills but an emergent competence that requires teachers to orchestrate multiple forms of knowledge in concert (McKenney et al., 2015). Mishra and Koehler (2006) articulated one critical component of this orchestration through the TPACK framework, which describes the intersecting knowledge domains that enable teachers to leverage technology for content-specific pedagogy. Subsequent scholarship has extended this integrative logic to STEM education, where effective lesson design demands the purposeful blending of scientific inquiry, technological application, engineering design, and mathematical reasoning (Kelley & Knowles, 2016). More recently, the global imperative for sustainability education has introduced a third integration dimension: ESD competences require teachers to embed sustainability issues, inquiry-based approaches to environmental challenges, and evaluative thinking about socio-scientific dilemmas into their science instruction (UNESCO, 2017; Purwianingsih et al., 2022).

Despite the recognized importance of each dimension, the empirical literature reveals a fragmented landscape. Studies examining TPACK development among pre-service science teachers are abundant (e.g., Offermann et al., 2025; Salleh et al., 2025), as are investigations of STEM integration competence (Tucker et al., 2024; Mansour et al., 2024) and, to a lesser extent, ESD pedagogical capabilities (Purwianingsih et al., 2022; Shumba & Kampamba, 2013). However, these research streams have developed largely in isolation from one another. Few studies have examined how pre-service teachers develop the ability to integrate all three dimensions simultaneously, and no study to date has modeled the structural relationships among TPACK, STEM, and ESD as mediating pathways through which an instructional intervention influences the quality of integrative lesson plans.

Project-Based Learning (PjBL) offers a theoretically compelling intervention for fostering integrative lesson design competence. PjBL, defined as an extended inquiry process structured around authentic driving questions and culminating in publicly shared artifacts (Krajcik & Shin, 2014), naturally elicits the simultaneous activation of multiple knowledge domains. When pre-service science teachers are tasked with designing lesson plans through a PjBL process, they must engage with technology to support inquiry (activating TPACK), draw upon interdisciplinary connections to address authentic problems (activating STEM integration), and consider sustainability dimensions of scientific issues (activating ESD competences). Empirical evidence supports PjBL's effectiveness in developing individual dimensions: Dewi et al. (2022) demonstrated that a PjBL scaffolding model improved pre-service teachers' TPACK, while Novallyan and Nehru (2025) found PjBL to be effective in teacher profession courses. Yet, the mechanism through which PjBL influences integrative lesson planning quality—whether directly or through the mediating enhancement of TPACK, STEM, and ESD competences—remains empirically untested.

This gap is consequential for both theory and practice. Theoretically, understanding whether PjBL operates through dimensional mediation (i.e., PjBL → TPACK/STEM/ESD → lesson plan quality) rather than through direct effects on lesson plan quality would advance our understanding of how pedagogical interventions translate into design competence. Such evidence would refine the Teacher Design Capacity framework (Brown, 2009) by specifying the compositional pathways through which design competence is constructed. Practically, identifying which integration dimension is most responsive to PjBL would enable teacher educators to calibrate their instructional emphasis and scaffolding strategies accordingly—for instance, providing additional support for dimensions that PjBL alone does not sufficiently develop.

The present study addresses these gaps by proposing and testing a structural model in which PjBL serves as the exogenous predictor of three integration dimensions (TPACK, STEM, and ESD), which in turn contribute to the quality of integrative lesson plans. The model is evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), a variance-based approach well suited to the exploratory-confirmatory nature of this investigation, the modest sample size (N = 95), and the formative characteristics of several constructs (Hair et al., 2022). Five research questions guide the investigation:

> **RQ1.** How do pre-service science teachers' TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration competences in lesson planning change from pre- to post-PjBL intervention?

> **RQ2.** Does PjBL implementation significantly influence the quality of lesson plan design across the TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration dimensions?

> **RQ3.** Which integration dimension (TPACK, STEM, or ESD) is most strongly influenced by PjBL?

> **RQ4.** How do TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration competences contribute to overall integrative lesson plan quality after PjBL implementation?

> **RQ5.** Do TPACK, STEM, and ESD improvements mediate the effect of PjBL on integrative lesson plan quality?

The following hypotheses are advanced based on the theoretical framework:

- **H1:** PjBL positively and significantly influences TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration competences.
- **H2:** TPACK, STEM, and ESD integration competences significantly contribute to integrative lesson plan quality.
- **H3:** TPACK, STEM, and ESD mediate the relationship between PjBL and integrative lesson plan quality.

This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it offers the first empirical test of an integrative model that simultaneously positions TPACK, STEM, and ESD as mediating dimensions between a pedagogical intervention and lesson plan quality. Second, it operationalizes integrative lesson plan quality as a higher-order construct assessed through rubric-based evaluation rather than self-report, enhancing the ecological validity of measurement. Third, by employing PLS-SEM to decompose direct, indirect, and total effects, the study provides granular insight into the mechanisms through which PjBL shapes pre-service science teachers' design competence—insight that has direct implications for curriculum design in teacher education institutions.
